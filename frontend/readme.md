# Frontend

The web user interface - or _front end_ - to the app.

This code uses React and functional components, together with the React Bootstrap framework. Vite was used to create the initial code.

You are free to customise this, ignore this, or replace this with any language and tooling of your choice.

Whatever you choose, you **must** have your frontend deployed as a static website on Azure. See instructions in the Useful Links section.

You will not be judged on your technology choices. You _will_ be judged on delivering _something_ at the deadline ;)

## Getting started

Navigate into the frontend directory, install and run :

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
